DataModel
---------
As per given table I have created 3 different objects.
N26Products (Child)
N26CountryCodes(Master)
N26ProductTypes(Master)

1.Since the as was to have a button or feature on Case Standard page layout I have choosen Lightning out
 -Wrtten a VF Page named N26ProductsLookupPage.vfp and embed this in stadard case page layout which uses Lighting App   N26ProductsDisplayApp and create N26ProductsDisplay.cmp . 
 -VF have extension CaseProductExtension.apxc which queries Contact object to get product__c and Home_Country_code__c
 - used Application event to link up button on VF and Lightning.


2.Created RestResource GetProductInfoByContact.apxc class for exposing it to external systems.
  -need to pass emailId as query parameter to '/GetN26ProductInfo' URI
  -Queried Contact object using email id and get the product_Type__c and Country_code__c
  -Queried N26Products object to get List of produts associated to the above contact.
  -Converted above list using JSON serialization and attached it to RESTContext Response.
  -Applied proper exception handling and HTTPstatus codes for error handling.
  -used oAuth2 mechanism by creating connected app to get product details of this API service with security id and security token.
